# Engines

Each engine represents a type of prediction. 

## Launching an Engine Instance

Let say you want to launch an instance of Item Recommendation Engine for product recommendation.

```
$ cd $PIO_HOME/engines/item-rec
$ ../../bin/pio <TODO>
```
You may launch more than one engine instance in PredictionIO.

If it is your first time using PredictionIO, these [tutorials and samples](/engines/tutorials.html) should be helpful.

## Built-in Engines

PredictionIO comes with the following engines. 

* Item Ranking
* Item Recommendation
* Item Similarity


## Building your own Engine

Please read the [Engine Builders' Guide](/enginebuilders/) for details.
