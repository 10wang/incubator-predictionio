###Build and Deploy Predictive Engines
####on production environments, in a fraction of the time.

PredictionIO is an open source Machine Learning Server for developers and data scientists to build and deploy predictive engines.
PredictionIO lets you quickly deploy an engine as a web service on production by choosing one from the template gallery.
PredictionIO lets you customize the code of every engine components, such as Data Source, Data Preparator, Algorithm(s) and Serving, for your specific business needs.
PredictionIO also enables you to evaluate, and tune, multiple engine variants systematically.  

PredictionIO consists of:

* **PredictionIO platform** - our open source machine learning stack for building, evaluating and deploying engines with machine learning algorithms. 
* **Event Server** - our open source machine learning analytics layer for unifying events from multiple platforms 
* **Template Gallery** - the place for you to download engine templates for different type of machine learning applications 

System Architecture:

PredictionIO can be optionally installed as a full stack, bundled with **Apache Spark**, **MLlib**, **HBase** and **Elasticsearch**, which simplifies and accelerates scalable machine learning infrastructure management.

## Why PredictionIO

PredictionIO currently offers 2 basic engine templates for Apache Spark MLlib:

* [Recommendation](/templates/recommendation/quickstart/) - with MLlib ALS
* [Classification](/templates/classification/quickstart/) - with MLlib Naive Bayes

It also offers an engine template with more business logics:

* [Similar Product](/templates/similarproduct/quickstart/) - with MLlib ALS and Cosine Similarity
* [Product Ranking](/templates/productranking/quickstart/) - with MLlib ALS


With these templates, you can create a custom predictive engine for production deployment efficiently:

* predict user behaviors and demand
* offer personalized video, news, deals, ads and job openings
* help users to discover interesting events, documents, apps and restaurants
* spam detection
* and more...

A standard PredictionIO stack is built on top of solid open source technology,
such as Scala, Apache Spark, HBase and Elasticsearch.
