###Build and Deploy Predictive Engines
####on production environments, in a fraction of the time.

PredictionIO is an open source Machine Learning Server for developers and data scientists to build and deploy predictive engines.
PredictionIO lets you quickly deploy an engine as a web service on production by choosing one from the template gallery.
PredictionIO lets you customize the code of every engine components for your specific business needs.
PredictionIO also enables you to evaluate, and tune, multiple engine variants systematically.

PredictionIO consists of:

* **PredictionIO platform** - our open source machine learning stack for building, evaluating and deploying engines with machine learning algorithms.
* **Event Server** - our open source machine learning analytics layer for unifying events from multiple platforms
* **Template Gallery** - the place for you to download engine templates for different type of machine learning applications
