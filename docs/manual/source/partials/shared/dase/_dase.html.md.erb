PredictionIO's DASE architecture brings the separation-of-concerns design
principle to predictive engine development. DASE stands for the following
components of an engine:

* **D**ata - includes Data Source and Data Preparator
* **A**lgorithm(s)
* **S**erving
* **E**valuator

Let's look at the code and see how you can customize the engine you built from the <%= template_name %>.

NOTE: Evaluator will not be covered in this tutorial.
