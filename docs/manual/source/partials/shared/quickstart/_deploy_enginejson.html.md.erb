Now you can build, train, and deploy the engine. First, make sure you are under the `<%= engine_name %>` directory.

```
$ cd <%= engine_name %>
```

### Engine.json

Under the directory, you should find an `engine.json` file; this is where you specify parameters for the engine.

WARNING: Make sure the `appId` defined in the file match your **App ID**.

```
  ...
  "datasource": {
    "params" : {
      "appId": 1
    }
  },
  ...
```
