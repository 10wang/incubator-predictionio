Let's create a sample app called "MyApp1" now. An app represents the application
that generates the data, e.g. a movie rental app.

```
$ pio app new MyApp1
```

You should find the following in the console output:

```
...
2014-11-18 12:38:47,636 INFO  tools.Console$ - Initialized Event Store for this app ID: 1.
2014-11-18 12:38:47,721 INFO  tools.Console$ - Created new app:
2014-11-18 12:38:47,722 INFO  tools.Console$ -       Name: MyApp1
2014-11-18 12:38:47,723 INFO  tools.Console$ -         ID: 1
2014-11-18 12:38:47,724 INFO  tools.Console$ - Access Key: 3mZWDzci2D5YsqAnqNnXH9SB6Rg3dsTBs8iHkK6X2i54IQsIZI1eEeQQyMfs7b3F
```

Take note of the **Access Key** and **App ID**. You will need the **Access Key**
to refer to "MyApp1" when you collect data. At the same time, you will use **App
ID** to refer to "MyApp1" in engine code.

`$ pio app list` will return a list of names and IDs of apps created in the Event Server.

```
$ pio app list
