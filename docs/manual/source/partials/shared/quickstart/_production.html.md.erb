INFO: To update the model periodically with new data, simply set up a cron job to call `pio train` and `pio deploy`. The engine will continue to serve prediction results during the re-train process. After the training is completed, `pio deploy` will automatically shutdown the existing engine server and bring up a new process on the same port.
