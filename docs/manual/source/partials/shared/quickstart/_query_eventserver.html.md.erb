You can query Event Server to confirm the data is imported successfully by going to following URL with your browser:

`http://localhost:7070/events.json?accessKey=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>`

or run the following command in terminal:

```
$ curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:7070/events.json?accessKey=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>"
```

It should return some of the events in JSON format if the import is successful. You can refer to [Event Server Debugging Recipes](/datacollection/eventapi/#debugging-recipes) for more different ways to query Event Server.
