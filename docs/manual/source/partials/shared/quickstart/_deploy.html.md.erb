Now you can build, train, and deploy the engine. First, make sure you are under the `<%= engine_name %>` directory.

```
$ cd <%= engine_name %>
```

Under the directory, you should find an `engine.json` file; this is where you specify parameters for the engine.

WARNING: Make sure the `appId` defined in the file match your **App ID**.

```
...
"datasource": {
  "params" : {
    "appId": 1
  }
},
...
```

### Building

Start with building your *<%= engine_name %>* engine.

```
$ pio build
```
This command should take few minutes for the first time; all subsequent builds should be less than a minute. You can also run it with --verbose to see all log messages.

Upon successful build, you should see a console message similar to the
following.

```
2014-11-21 16:37:25,817 INFO  tools.Console$ - Your engine is ready for training.
```

### Training the Predictive Model

Train your engine.

```
$ pio train
```

When your engine is trained successfully, you should see a console message
similar to the following.

```
2014-11-21 16:33:17,528 INFO  workflow.CoreWorkflow$ - Your engine has been trained successfully.
```

### Deploying the Engine

Now your engine is ready to deploy.

```
$ pio deploy
```

This will deploy an engine that binds to http://localhost:8000. You can visit
that page in your web browser to check its status.
