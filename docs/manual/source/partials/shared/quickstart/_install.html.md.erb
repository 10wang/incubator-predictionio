First you need to [install PredictionIO <%= data.versions.pio %>](/install) (if you haven't done it).

Let's say you have installed PredictionIO at `/home/yourname/PredictionIO/`.
For convenience, add PredictionIO's binary command path to your `PATH`, i.e.
`/home/yourname/PredictionIO/bin`:

```
$ PATH=$PATH:/home/yourname/PredictionIO/bin; export PATH
```

NOTE: If you installed from AWS Marketplace, the path is located at /opt/PredictionIO/bin

Once you have completed the installation process, please make sure all the components (HBase, ElasticSearch) are up and running. You can check the status by running:

```
$ pio status
```

NOTE: If you have issues with `pio status`, please see [FAQ - Using PredictionIO](/resources/faq/#using-predictionio).

and please make sure that PredictionIO Event Server, which collects data, is
running:

```
$ pio eventserver
```
