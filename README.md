PredictionIO
============

PredictionIO is a prediction server for building smart applications. While you search data through a database server, you can make prediction through PredictionIO.

With PredictionIO, you can write apps
* that predict user behaviors based on solid data science
*	using your choice of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms
*	without worrying about scalability

Detailed documentation *will be* available on our [wiki](https://github.com/PredictionIO/PredictionIO/wiki) page.

STEP-BY-STEP TUTORIAL – Build a Recommendation Engine with 5 steps
==================================================================

In this tutorial, we are building a unique recommendation engine on PredictionIO for a restaurant discovery app. Sign into PredictionIO web admin panel using the administrator account you have created during installation. Then follow these 5 steps:

Step 1: Add your App
--------------------
In the Applications page, add a new app by giving it a name, e.g. ‘My Restaurant App’, and click [Create].

Step 2:  Obtain an App Key
--------------------------
Click [Develop] on ‘My Restaurant App’, and you will find: (1) API Endpoint; (2) App Key. These are the information you need to integrate your app with PredictionIO SDKs later.
