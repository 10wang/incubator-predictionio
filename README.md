## Documentation

PredictionIOâ€™s documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted at <http://docs.prediction.io/current/>. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.4.x).
  - **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.
2. Install the Ruby-based syntax highlighter, [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge), with `gem install rouge`.
3. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
4. Open Server address ( http://0.0.0.0:4000/0.8.1/ ) in your browser, and you should see the documentation.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
